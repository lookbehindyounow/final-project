# Final project - (disgr)ace combat
#### name's gonna change at some point

It's gonna be a flying/dogfighting game in 3d which I'm making in godot & the goal is essentially to make a clone of ace combat x on the psp - or as close as I can reasonably make it, gameplay wise. If I have time I'll stick a website on it for leaderboards to tick all the web dev boxes, if it turns out to be too ambitious I'll just make it top down 2d with way more obstacles; buildings & bridges & such

### MVP:
- moving/attacking player
- moving/attacking enemy(s)
